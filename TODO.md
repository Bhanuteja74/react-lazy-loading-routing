# React Routing and Lazy Loading â€” Learning Tracker

## âœ… What I Have Learned

- Lazy loading components using `lazy()` and `Suspense`.
- Observed network behavior (components fetched on demand, cached with 304).
- Installed and configured `react-router-dom`.
- Wrapped app with `<BrowserRouter>`.
- Replaced manual `useState`-based rendering with proper routing.
- Created basic routes using `<Routes>` and `<Route>`.
- Implemented a 404 Page with wildcard route (`path="*"`).
- Understood Nested Routes and centralized route structure.
- Used `<Outlet />` to render child routes inside parent components.
- Understood relative paths for child routes (avoid leading `/`).
- Applied Lazy Loading to nested/child routes as well.
- Used `index` route for default child rendering.
- Reduced redundancy with `<Navigate>` for redirects.
- Used programmatic navigation with `useNavigate` and `<Navigate>`.
